        <p>I interviews weirdos. You can read my transcripts.</p>
        <p>I like describing weirdness with a single measurement. How long can you talk to a stranger? What weird thing have you wasted all your money on? How long can you sit still? I want to find what makes you weird.</p>

        <h3 class="align-center light-bottom-border">I Don't Like Being Bored</h3>
        <p>When I'm at the beach I'm comfortable doing nothing. I sit in the sand and listen to the waves. I don't feel bored.</p>
        <p>But when I'm at work, I stay busy. If I get bored, I find something to do. Why?</p>
        <p>I live in a market economy. In theory, I trade stuff I make for stuff I want. Otherwise, I get hungry.</p>
        <p>But I want the same house, car and food most people want. And most people around me don't work on building the house I live in or the car I drive.</p>
        <p>What is everyone doing all day to avoid getting bored?</p>

        <h3 class="align-center light-bottom-border">People Get Weird</h3>
        <p>America is full of weirdos. People find an obsession (like monster trucks) and spend tons of time and money on it. Or people think up a business and convince millions of people to buy a product they never knew they needed.</p>
        <p>It's not just money. Ultra-marathoning costs as much as a pair of shoes.</p>
        <p>I want to figure out people become weird. How do I find an obsession?</p>
