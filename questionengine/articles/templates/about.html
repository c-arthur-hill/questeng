    </div>
    <div class="padding-10">
        <p>You could die right now. Comet strike, heart attack, snake bite.</p>
        <p>Your brain gets anxious to keep you alive. Today's number one goal is to avoid a fast death. Fear of death keeps you focused on food, shelter, etc.</p>
        <p>The first type of interview on this site asks people how they <strong>avoid a fast death.</strong></p>
        <p>Most people use money from a job to avoid a fast death. With millions of careers in the economy, I ask how people how they found their career. I ask if they feel daily fear in their current situation. Sometimes, I find someone who lives fear-free without much money. I interview them too. </p>

        <h3 class="align-center light-bottom-border">Slow Death Fear</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="padding-10">
        <p>After a lifetime of avoiding a fast death, you will die a slow death of old age. Congradulations!</p>
        <p>You may be depressed at this reality. Humans are the only animal aware that others have conscious minds just like yours. Why were you given the mind you think with and the eyes you see through if you will surely die?</p>
        <p>When I answered this question, I found peace & happiness. Each person's purpose is to find how they are different from everyone else. Why were you given your perspective on this world?</p>
        <p>The second type of interview on this site asks people how they came to <strong>accept an eventual slow death.</strong></p>
        <p>How is their perspective different from everyone elses? How do they use their difference to improve their community. How they will feel as death approaches.</p>
