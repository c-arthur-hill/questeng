    </div>
    <p>You have no place to practice talking.</p>
    <p>
    Talking is important. A first date is talking. A job interview is talking. 
    </p>
    <p>
    When you're a boring jerk, people stop talking to you. You need to practice.

        <h3 class="align-center">Solution</h3>
    </div>
    <p>You talk here. You try new things and make mistakes.</p>
    <p>You find what you want to talk about. You become interested in something. You become interesting.</p>
    <p>
    You find people who share your interests. You ask them questions. You learn from them. They learn from you. You respect each other.
