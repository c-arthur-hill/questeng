        <p>I interviews weirdos. You can read my transcripts.</p>
        <p>I like measuring weirdness. How long can you talk to a stranger? What weird thing have you wasted all your money on? How long can you sit still? I like finding how a person became weird.</p>

    <div class="full-width overflow-hidden">
        <h3 class="align-center light-bottom-border">Why Be Weird</h3>
        <p>I want to find how I'm weird. I want to make something better than anything I could buy. I want to sell it to people who think it's better than anything they could buy. I want to wake up with weird things I want to do each day.</p>
        <p>I live in a market economy. I trade stuff I make for stuff I want. Otherwise, I get hungry.</p>
        <p>I basically want the same houses, cars and food you want. But you won't build the house I live in or the car I drive. Big companies already make most of the stuff I want. For example, Ferrari makes better cars than either of us. </p>
        <p>Big companies make normal stuff. I want to make something weird. I want to find weird experiences I can't just buy. I want to be weird.</p>

        <h3 class="align-center light-bottom-border">How To Be Weird</h3>
        <p>America is full of weirdos. People spend tons of money on obsessions like monster trucks. Or they think up a business and convince millions of people to buy a product they never knew they needed.</p>
        <p>It's not just money. Ultra-marathoning only costs as much as a pair of shoes.</p>
        <p>I want to figure out how these people become weird. So I ask them.</p>
