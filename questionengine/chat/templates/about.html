<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>You have no place to practice talking.</p>
<p>
Talking is important. A first date is a talking test. A job interview is a talking test. 
</p>
<p>
Someone will stop talking to you when: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>You don't listen. You talk about what you want.</li>
    <li>You don't have anything to talk about.</li>
    <li>You make them feel bad about themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>You need a place to practice avoiding these mistakes.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>You talk here. You practice talking longer.</p>
<ol>
    <li>You learn to ask questions that show you're listening.</li>
    <li>You find new things to talk about.</li>
    <li>You stop being a jerk.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is your place to make mistakes. You don't care what this site thinks of you. 
</ol>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
I'm Calvin. I'm a real person. I'm shaky at yoga. I do deadlifts on Saturday afternoons. I eat lots of burritos. My favorite place is the beach.
</p>
<p>
I live in Sanford, Florida. I'm a web developer at Seminole State College. I like building web sites.
</p>
<p>
I'm kind of quiet. Sometimes that's useful. Sometimes I want to talk more.
</p>
<p>
I like talking to interesting people. Email me your questions:
