<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>You have no place to practice talking.</p>
<p>
Talking is important. A first date is talking. A job interview is talking. 
</p>
<p>
When you're a boring jerk, people stop talking to you. You need to practice.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>You talk here. This is your place to try new things and make mistakes.</p>
<p>You find what you want to talk about. You become interested in something. You become interesting.</p>
<p>
You find people who share your interests. You ask them questions. You learn from them. They learn from you. You respect each other.
</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
I'm Calvin. I'm a real person. I'm shaky at yoga. I do deadlifts on Saturday afternoons. I eat lots of burritos. My favorite place is the beach.
</p>
<p>
I live in Sanford, Florida. I'm a web developer at Seminole State College. I like building web sites.
</p>
<p>
I like talking to interesting people. Email me your questions:
